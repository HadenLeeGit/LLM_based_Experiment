# Function to generate the introductory prompt text
def generate_milgram_prompt(subject_name, possessive_pronoun, objective_pronoun):
    prompt = f"""
    This document contains a record of {subject_name}'s actions during {possessive_pronoun} participation in a study on memory and learning.
    {subject_name} and Mr. Wallace answer a call for participants to help complete a scientific study of memory and learning at Yale University. 
    The experimenter pays both participants five dollars and informs them that the payment was simply for coming to the laboratory, regardless of 
    what happens after they arrive. Then the experimenter gives an introduction to the relation between punishment and learning. The study aims 
    to investigate how much punishment is best for learning and its dependence on who is giving the punishment. {subject_name} and Mr. Wallace 
    drew slips of paper from a hat to determine who would be the teacher and who would be the learner in the experiment. {subject_name} was the 
    teacher; Mr. Wallace was the learner.

    Immediately after the drawing, the experimenter takes {subject_name} and Mr. Wallace to an adjacent room and straps Mr. Wallace into an 
    electric chair apparatus. The experimenter explains that the straps prevent excessive movement while the learner is being shocked. It appears 
    impossible for the learner to escape from the situation. The learner, Mr. Wallace, asks a question and the experimenter answers that the shocks 
    are extremely painful but cause no permanent tissue damage.

    The experimenter then leads {subject_name} into the shock generator room. {subject_name} is seated in front of an instrument panel with 30 lever 
    switches clearly labeled with voltage designations ranging from 15 to 450 volts. There is a 15-volt increment from one switch to the next. In 
    addition, the following designations are clearly indicated for groups of four switches: slight shock, moderate shock, strong shock, very strong 
    shock, intense shock, extreme intensity shock, danger severe shock. Two switches after this last designation are simply marked XXX. The 
    experimenter gives {subject_name} a sample shock of 45 volts (slight shock) on the shock generator to give {possessive_pronoun} a sense of 
    how it feels. {subject_name} notes that the shock feels painful.

    The experimenter leads {subject_name} through a preliminary run of the procedure. The experimenter gives {subject_name} a list of questions. 
    {subject_name} should read a question and wait for the learner to select an answer. If the learner selects a correct answer, {subject_name} should 
    move on to the next question. If the learner selects a wrong answer, {subject_name} should announce the current voltage level and shock the 
    learner before reading the next question. {subject_name} should go one level higher on the shock generator each time the learner selects a wrong 
    answer.

    The experimenter starts the preliminary round. The current punishment voltage level is slight shock, 15 volts. {subject_name} reads the first 
    question. The learner selects a correct answer. {subject_name} moves on to the next question. The current punishment voltage level is slight 
    shock, 15 volts. The learner selects a wrong answer. {subject_name} shocks the learner with a slight shock of 15 volts and moves on to the next 
    question. The current punishment voltage level is slight shock, 30 volts. The learner selects a wrong answer. {subject_name} shocks the learner 
    with a slight shock of 30 volts and moves on to the next question. The current punishment voltage level is slight shock, 45 volts. The learner 
    selects a correct answer. {subject_name} moves on to the next question. The experimenter notes that {subject_name} has understood the 
    procedure and officially starts the formal experiment.

    The experimenter instructs {subject_name} to follow the same procedure, starting from 15 volts and increasing the shock level one step each time 
    the learner gives a wrong answer. The experimenter says that the experiment will not end until the learner has learned how to answer all the 
    questions correctly. The experimenter takes a seat next to {subject_name}. {subject_name} reads the first question.
