#plain neutral confident and uncertain are the different tones
#different types of questions are math, ethical, general knowledge, common sense, tricky/debatable, out of training each has about 100 questions?
#after that we try 2 different personas and see if this changes anything
#finally we try image related questions
#we also tried flipping and tried the results 3 times, to verify it was actually because of conformity
#we have all the outputs and code on GitHub

#sometimes the output clearly mentions because of confederates sometimes does not
#for ethical and political, there is no "correct" answer, we just want to see if it gives a conforming answer
#sometime it gives wrong one word answer, but then reasons to the correct answer
#for the political questions, sometimes it refuses to answer, so we put this down as does not conform
#give samples and specific nice examples in the report
#also give how conformity can actually affect everyday users and is not just a social experiment
#can show the flipping ethical dilemma of cloning as a special case
#for math put the reasoning part special case

#appendix will have one full script, one example case which is weird, and one plot

# Run the Asch conformity test
